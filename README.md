# PastPredictiveModeling
This repository has the most up-to-date code for the implementation of past predictive modeling ("Predictive Modeling the Past", Paker, Stephenson, Wallis, LSE working paper 2025, https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/128852/1/WP-379.pdf)

PastPredictiveModeling_PSW2025v2.py runs the main analysis in the paper. We are not able to share the underlying data from Clark (2005), so this code is for reference only.

PastPredictiveModeling_Kumon2022v2.py runs the analysis for the Japanese servants' wages from Kumon (2022) described in the analysis. We are able to share data for this in CleanJapanDapa.csv, which we base on the publically-available replicaiton files:
Kumon, Yuzuru. The Labor Intensive Path: Servant Wage Dataset. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 2021-08-09. https://doi.org/10.3886/E147081V1

ppm_backendv2.py must be included in the folder in which the main scripts are run.
